 This mini personal project aims to explore the cost of living situation in the UK during the summer of 2022.
 This involves exploring data related to household expenditure, rising energy prices and household income.

The project draws on data sources and insights drawn from an ONS report on "[Energy prices and their effect on households](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/energypricesandtheireffectonhouseholds/2022-02-01)" from February 2022.
