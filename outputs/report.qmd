## The rising price of energy and its impact on household cost of living

NOTES:

-   Policy recommendations to protect households from the rising cost of living due to energy price increases. To include:

-   Changes in gas price

-   Impact of energy prices on CPI - comparative chart of percentage change in pricing of different product cats - mention knock on effect of rising costs elsewhere with sources

-   Household finances stats - how much people spent on energy in 2021 compared to now and with next cap starting from Oct 2022.

-   Wage changes: The three-month average real-time pay as of June 2022 was a 2.5% reduction in pay. ([ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/a3ww/lms))

## Main Points


## Gas Prices

The price of natural gas a risen sharply over the last 18 months. As @fig-gas2018 and shows, prices have risen from an average value in the UK market in the week leading to 28/08/2020 of 0.76 p/kWh to 3.75 p/kWh for the same period of 2021 to 16.75 p/kWh in the same period of 2022.

According to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-62644537) the resurgence of global economic activity in the recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a sharp increase in the demand of natural gas causing prices to rise and the geopolitical fallout of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 exasperated this further (with Russia being the largest exported of gas in the world).

The average market price of gas from the start of 2018 to the end of 2020 was 1.4 p/kWh, whereas in the over the period of 28 July 2022 to 28 August 2022 this averaged at 12.2 p/kWh - an increase of 890%.

## Household Gas Prices

The price of gas (and electricity) that households pay is controlled the [OFGEM price cap](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/check-if-energy-price-cap-affects-you). This sets an upper limit on the amount that energy suppliers are allowed to charge households per unit of fuel. Since the surge in wholesale market prices of gas, the default tariffs charged by energy suppliers have been inline with this maximum permitted charge.

The current price cap, which has been in effect since 1 April 2022, fixes the price of gas at 7 p/kWh and electricity at 28 p/kWh. As can be seen in @fig-gas2021, this has insulated households from the worst of the increase in market prices for the previous several months where in gas prices have averaged 7.5 p/kWh over the last six months, 12.2 p/kWh over the last month and at the time of writing are \>16 p/kWh.

![Gas prices from 2021 onward](gas_prices_2021.png){#fig-gas2021 fig-alt="The system average price of gas since 2021, showing a steep increase from around mid-2021. The typical price increases from less than 2 pence per kilo watt hour to 16 currently."}

However, the price cap has been announced to be rising to 15 p/kWh for gas and 52 p/kWh from 1 October 2022. This marks a substantial increase in the cost of household energy of nearly 80% from what is a comparatively high cost already (compared to the average market unit price of gas of 1.4 p/kWh in years 2018 to 2020).

## Inflation

The rising price of energy has been a key driver in the rise of inflation. In the UK, the official measure of price inflation is the Consumer Price Index with Housing (CPIH). This measures the change in price of common consumer goods and services and weighs the relative impact of each price change by the typical proportion of total expenditure spent on each good/service.

![Inflationary changes by different categories of goods and services](indices_change.png){#fig-inflation}

As @fig-inflation shows, the typical annual percentage change in the prices of goods and services has been creeping up, with an overall annual rate increase of 8.8% for July 2022. Breaking down by sectors this shows inflation is primarily driven by price changes in transport (with a 15.1% annual cost increase), food (with a 12.7% increase) and housing costs (which is includes household energy bills, with a 9.1% increase). The most stark increase however is visible when you plot the annual price changes for energy as separate goods/services with the price of household gas having increased by 96% in July 2022 from a year earlier.

The reason the rise of energy prices do not more strongly contribute to the inflation rate (with a current annual inflation rate of 1.87 percentage points from electricity, gas and other fuels in total according to the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/july2022)) is that energy is only weighted with less than three per cent of a typical consumers expenditure, reflecting spending habits from 2021 before prices soared.

## Household finances and energy costs

A study by ONS explored [family spending in the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/familyspendingworkbook1detailedexpenditureandtrends) up to March 2021. This showed that in the financial year ending 2021, the average household spent 4.8% of its expenditure on energy. 

It also revealed this proportion is not uniform across income thresholds but rather lower income households spent a higher proportion of their income on energy. The lowest 10 per cent of households by income spent on average 8.3 per cent of their total expenditure on energy compared to 3.3 per cent in the top 10 per cent of households by income.

A very simplistic analysis, taking the typical family household expenditure on energy in the financial year ending in 2021 and inflating this by the 70% price increase from July 2021 to July 2022 from the CPIH figures and assuming a 5.1 % increase in total household expenditure (inline with the [5.1 % year-on-year three month average wage growth reported in June 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/kac3/lms)) gives revised estimates of households currently spending on average 8.6% of total expenditure on energy. For the lowest house income decile this would be 14% compared to 6% for the highest household income decile. 

Assuming an additional rise in household energy spending of 80%, inline with the expected rise in Ofgem price cap prices, could mean from October 2022 average households may be spending as much as 15% of their total expenditure on energy. For the lowest income decile households this could be as much as 25% of total expenditure compared to 11% for the highest income decile households. 

These estimates should be used with caution and are intended as illustrative rather than scientific. With that said, they represent a significant increase from the average of approximately 5% spent on energy during 2021. This particualrly concerning when coupled with the general increase in prices for other goods and services that are expected as [businesses pass on their increased costs of energy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62813782) (which are not protected by the Ofgem price cap) to consumers. 

## Public opinion

The latest [Public opinions and social trends: household finances](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/datasets/publicopinionsandsocialtrendsgreatbritainhouseholdfinances) data (covering 17 to 29 August 2022) show the vast majority of the general public have concerns with rising cost of living. 

91 per cent of responds said their cost of living had increased, of which 79 per cent said their gas or electricity bills had increased. This is less than the 96 per cent of respondents who said they the price of their food bill had increased. However, when asked which price increase that were most worried about, 62 per cent responded with the energy pricing compared to 18 per cent who said food pricing concerned them the most.
